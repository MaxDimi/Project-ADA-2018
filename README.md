# Influence  of  Russian  trolls on American elections


# Abstract
Among the enormous volume of tweets exchanged during the 2016 US presidential election campaign, millions were sent by alleged Russian troll accounts. Those accounts have been accused of manipulating the campaign and its outcome.

Given how dramatic and dangerous the consequences of a country influencing the democratic process of another can be, we want to get a better insight on the methods and the real effects of the trolls.

On one side, we will compare their activities with the evolution of popularity of the candidates along the campaign. We will also take a look at the major events of the election and determine if they were influenced by the trolls and vice-versa.

On the other side, we will study the methods employed by the Russians to disrupt the presidential election. We will examine their vocabulary, the subjects they discuss as well as the media and people they refer to.


# Research questions
* Is there a relation between the candidates popularities and the activities of the trolls?
* Did the trolls influence the major events of the campaign? Is it the other way around?
* Which subjects are discussed by the trolls, and which semantics do they use?
* Which media do they tend to talk about and link in their posts?
* Do they tend to show direct support or hatred for specific people?
* Did the strategy of the trolls change over time?


# Dataset
The main dataset we are going to use for this project is the [Russian Troll Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets) dataset from Kaggle. It contains around 3 million tweets of accounts associated with IRA. It gives information about the account itself (Twitter handle, number of followers and following, type of troll...), and about the individual tweet (content, date and time of publication, type of post, number of retweets...).

Regarding the popularities of the candidates, we have identified an important amount of possible data source on [realclearpolitics.com](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/#). Finding the relevant and useable data is part of our future milestones. [Some websites](https://cesrusc.org/election/) propose their election forecast in csv format, making it easy for us to deal with it.

We can also take a look at the events after the campaign, with for example the evolution of the approval rate of Donald Trump proposed by [FiveFirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo).

Finally, for the timeline of the campaign and its major events, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016_timeline) has a lot of information.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Identify and gather relevant and useful data.
* Take a first look at those data and get an idea of their size, representation, basic statistics, missing values...
* Decide which tools are the best suited for our project.
* Clean the data and reduce them into smaller dataframes containing the relevant information.
* Read studies that have already been conducted on our subject.
* Adapt the orientation of our project and our milestones according to our findings.

# Questions for TAs
* What do you think of the scope of our project? Should we restrict/broaden it?
* What if we arrive at the conclusion that the Russian trolls did not have a significant impact on the election? Is the social aspect of the project sufficient?
